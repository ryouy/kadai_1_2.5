Array b copies from Array a in line 10, this means all elements
in array b are dynamically same as each all elements in Array a.
And this system caused this phenmenon.
Once any elements in Array a are changed, corresponded elements
in array b will be changed to the same number as array a.
In this situation, when a[0] changed to 777 in line 17, at the
same time b[0] also changedto 777 because like I mentioned before,
Array b is a dynamic copy of Array a.
