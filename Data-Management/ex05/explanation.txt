Problem B. Music streaming platform
This model follwos problem discriptions correctly I hope.
I created this ER model with paying
attention to people who use and manage daily.
You can find programmer entity who manages this
platform and get salaly from music label.
Then user can give evaluation to each songs and
albums. Also, passward is a week attribute.
Futhermore, I think artist can join some bands usually,
so I described about their information.
Finally, music label operates this platform and ask
programmers to manage it.
By the way, I always use the sorting function in playlists.
So I implemented it.
