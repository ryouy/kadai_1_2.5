If you decide to purchase a RAID array for your personal home use,
I reccomend you to use RAID1.
I have 2 reasons for this.

First, you need at least 2 machines for RAID1, which means the
cost is reasonable for your usage in you house.

Second, as long as 1 disk works, array keeps working. Then you can
maintain this system by changing defective disks. In short you can
trust this system much for its perfomance and reliability. It's
not quite good compared to others, but I think it's enough for
personal usage.

In conclusion, from the point of view of perfomance and cost,
RAID1 is better than other systems.
