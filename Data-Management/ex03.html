<h1 id="exercises-spreadsheet-systems">Exercises (Spreadsheet
Systems)</h1>
<h2 id="sales-v2">Task 1 (2 points). Sales v2</h2>
<p>Recreate the <code>Sales</code> table, shown on the Slide 14 of the
Lecture 4. Use conditional formatting to highlight “good” sales (more
than 100 ice cream bars) with green background. Add “Day of Week” column
as shown on the Slide 18, and use conditional formatting to highlight
weekends with yellow background</p>
<h2 id="sea-day">Task 2 (3 points). Sea Day</h2>
<p>Sea Day is celebrated on the 3rd Monday of July. Create a formula
that shows the date of Sea Day in any given year (the user can input the
year into a certain cell, and the formula shows the Sea Day date in
another cell).</p>
<p>Check your solution using <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/japan/sea-day">this
table</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure that your formula works correctly if the first day of July
is Monday (such as in 2013).</p>
<p>Hints:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The function <code>=DATE(year, month, day)</code> converts three
numbers representing year, month, and day to a single <em>serial
number</em> that represents a date in Excel.</p></li>
<li><p>The function <code>=WEEKDAY(serial_number)</code> returns an
integer [1..7] corresponding to the day of week for the given
<code>serial_number</code> date.</p></li>
<li><p>To calculate a date after <code>d</code> days from the given date
<code>serial_number</code>, use the expression
<code>serial_number + d</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Excel displays serial numbers as date strings (such as
“2018年6月1日”).</p></li>
<li><p>It might be useful to find the day of week of the 1st of July of
the given year.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="doctoral-students-v2">Task 3 (3 points). Doctoral Students
v2</h2>
<p>Here is a shortened excerpt from the University of Aizu regulations
on PhD students:</p>
<p><em>Students must satisfy either one of the requirements below for
conferment of a doctoral degree: (A) the student has two or more papers
accepted by academic journals prior to the final dissertation review, at
least one of which must have been accepted by a journal which is
recognized as a major journal, or (B) the student has one paper accepted
by a major journal, and has at least 2 examined papers which have been
published in proceedings of major international conferences.</em></p>
<p>Prepare an Excel table with three cells where a student can enter the
following numbers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The number of papers published in proceedings of major international
conferences.</li>
<li>The number of papers published in major journals.</li>
<li>The total number of papers published in journals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Create a formula that prints “Yes” or “No” depending on whether the
student satisfies the requirements for conferment a doctoral degree.</p>
<h2 id="correlations-v2">Task 4 (2 points). Correlations v2</h2>
<p>Prepare a table of three columns:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Japanese prefecture names.</li>
<li>The number of convenience stores per 100 000 people.</li>
<li>The number of ski &amp; snowboard users per 100 people..</li>
</ol>
<p>Use data from these pages: <a href="https://stats-japan.com/t/kiji/19709">Number of Ski &amp;
Snowboard Players</a> and <a href="https://stats-japan.com/t/kiji/10328">Convenience Stores</a>.</p>
<p>Is there any correlation between these data series? Calculate
correlation coefficient and create a scatter graph showing the
relations.</p>
<h2 id="section">Submission Instructions. </h2>
<p>Create an Excel workbook with a separate sheet for each problem.
Upload the workbook to the course Moodle.</p>
